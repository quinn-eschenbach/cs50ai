# Analysis

## Layer 7, Head 1

It pays attention between "her" and "sister" in the fist example and "peter" and "he" in second example.
So here the pronoun pays attention to its subject.

Example Sentences:
- My sister loves [MASK] so i bought her some.
- Peter has a [MASK] car, thats why he beat me in a race.

## Layer 1, Head 12

"Food" pays attention to "spicy" and "car" to "fast", so we could deduct that this head connects adjectives to their nouns.

Example Sentences:
- TODO She [MASK] food and it was spicy.
- TODO [MASK] said her car is fast
